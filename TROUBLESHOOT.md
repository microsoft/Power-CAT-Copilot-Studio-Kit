# Troubleshoot errors in Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit

## Authentication errors

Typically, two app registrations need to be created for the end user authentication:

**KitAuthApp** – Used in Copilot Studio Kit agent configurations

**CopilotStudioAuthApp**  - Used in Copilot Studio, linked to KitAuthApp

#### General checklist
* Ensure that the custom agent (Copilot Studio) and the Copilot Studio Kit are on the same tenant
* Before enabling end user authentication, make sure authentication is disabled on both the custom agent and agent configuration in Copilot Studio Kit and run simple test to verify that the connectivity works

#### Checklist for KitAuthApp
*	In Azure Portal, Authentication, verify that SPA Redirect URI has the Dataverse URI where Copilot Studio Kit is deployed to
*	Verify that implicit grant and hybrid flows are enabled for Access tokens and ID tokens
*	Verify that supported account types is “Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)”
*	In API permissions, verify that User.Read permission is in the list, delegated and has admin consent granted

#### Checklist for CopilotStudioAuthApp
*	In Azure Portal, Authentication, verify that Web Redirect URI has
    * https://europe.token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect
    * https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect	
* Verify that implicit grant and hybrid flows are enabled for Access tokens and ID tokens
* Verify that supported account types is “Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)”
* In Certificates & secrets, ensure client secret is generated and used in Copilot Studio agent configuration (Settings->Security->Authentication->Client secret)
* In API permissions, verify that openid, profile and User.Read are in the list, delegated and admin consent granted
* In Expose an API, verify that custom scope is created, admins and users can consent and it is enabled. Verify that it is entered in Copilot Studio agent configuration (Settings->Security->Authentication->Token exchange URL)
* Verify that the client id of KitAuthApp is in the Authorized client applications.

#### Checklist for the agent configuration in Copilot Studio
* In Settings->Security->Authentication, verify that
  * Authenticate Manually is enabled
  * Users are required to sign in (at least for the troubleshooting purposes)
  * Redirect URL is set (https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect)
  * Service provider is Azure Active Directory v2
  * Client ID is the client id of CopilotStudioAuthApp
  * Client secret is the one generated for CopilotStudioAuthApp
  * Token Exchange Url is the custom scope created in CopilotStudioAuthApp
  * Scopes include at least profile and openid
*	Make sure bot has been published with this configuration
*	Ensure that test pane works
*	Ensure that demo site works (including login)

#### Checklist for the agent configuration in Copilot Studio Kit
* Ensure token endpoint is correctly set (copied from mobile channel) OR channel security is set and the correct secret is configured
* Ensure user authentication is set to “Entra ID v2”
* Ensure that the Client ID is the client id of KitAuthApp
* Ensure  Scope is the custom scope created in CopilotStudioAuthApp and same as in Copilot Studio authentication settings

#### Checklist for test configuration
* Try your test with and without sending the conversation start event (found from Advanced tab on the test), depending on your agent configuration this might make a difference

#### Checklist for the browser
* Ensure that third-party cookies are allowed from the browser

## Test Run Errors

If any cloud flow fails to run, the corresponding step status will be **Error**.

On the Test Run record, the **Error Details** will display a URL to navigate to the failed cloud flow run instance:

You can then troubleshoot further in Power Automate:
