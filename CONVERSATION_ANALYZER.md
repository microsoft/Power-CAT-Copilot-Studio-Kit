# Conversation Analyzer (Preview)

Conversation analyzer allows makers to analyze the conversation transcripts of their Copilot Studio custom agents using custom prompts. The feature comes with two precanned prompts, sentiment analysis and PII analysis. Custom prompts can be created, used, saved and reused later. Using custom prompts to analyze the conversations can provide insights not available through traditional analytics.
