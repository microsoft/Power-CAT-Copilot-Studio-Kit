# Enable user authentication

Copilot Studio Kit supports testing custom Copilots with user authentication enabled using Entra ID v2 (Azure Active Directory v2) as the service provider.

For more information on how to enable user authentication for custom Copilot in **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, please see https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/configuration-authentication-azure-ad

> [!WARNING]  
> There is a known issue with the Entra ID v2 user authentication that we are working on and expect to mitigate shortly.

## Modify the user authentication application

To enable user authentication support on **Copilot Studio Kit**, Dataverse environment URL has to be added as single-page application redirect URI on the application registration used for the user authentication.

Please note that user authentication has to be enabled in **Microsoft Copilot Studio** and application registration created before proceeding with these steps.

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Navigate to the App registrations.
1. Locate and select the application used for user authentication
1. Note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID - these will be used later in Copilot Configuration as **Client ID** and **Tenant ID**.
1. In the sidebar, navigate to Manage > Authentication.
1. Add your Dataverse environment URL (https://<hostname>.crm.dynamics.com/) to the Single-page application redirect URI list.

## Enable user authentication on your Copilot configuration

Before following these steps, make sure you have installed Copilot Studio Kit following the [installation instructions](./INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

1. Navigate to **Copilot Studio Kit**.
1. Select **Copilots** to view the Copilot Configurations.
1. Create new configuration by pressing **New** or open existing Copilot configuration
1. From **User Authentication** drop-down list, select **Entra ID v2**
1. Enter the **Client ID** and **Tenant ID** of your user authentication application registration (as noted earlier)
1. Fill other required values as required
1. Save

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are planning to test Copilots using SharePoint as their knowledge source, you need to add Files.Read.All and Sites.Read.All delegated API permissions to your application. Remember to specify the same scopes in Copilot Studio as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/nlu-generative-answers-sharepoint-onedrive#advanced-authentication-scenarios).
