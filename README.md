# Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit

The **Power CAT Copilot Studio Kit** is a comprehensive set of capabilities designed to augment [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudio). The kit helps makers develop and test custom agents, use large language model to validate AI-generated content, optimize prompts, and track aggregated key performance indicators of their custom agents.

# Features
## Testing capabilities  
Copilot Studio Kit allows makers to configure agents, tests and test sets, and use them to batch test their custom agents. Test runs produce detailed results including latencies, observed responses and run level aggregates. Different test types include response match, attachment match, topic match and generative answers which leverages AI Builder for response analysis. 

***Copilot Studio Kit test automation now supports multi-turn testing using all supported test types.***

## Conversation KPIs
Conversation KPIs are designed to help makers track and analyze the performance of their custom agents. This feature complements the existing analytics built-in the Copilot Studio and simplifies the process of understanding conversation outcomes by providing aggregated data in Dataverse rather than requiring you to analyze the complex conversation transcripts. 

More information on [conversation KPIs](./CONVERSATION_KPIS.md)

## SharePoint synchronization
SharePoint synchronization allows makers to configure periodical selective content synchronization from SharePoint locations to custom agent knowledge base as files.

More information on [SharePoint synchronization](./FILE_SYNCHRONIZATION.md)

## Prompt Advisor
Prompt Advisor allows makers to develop effective prompts while learning useful prompt engineering skills. Prompts entered in the advisor tool will be analyzed and receive a confidence evaluation with detailed reasoning for the score. Advisor also provides a list of suggested refined prompts implementing various prompt techniques. Makers can select from these optimized prompts to iteratively refine and improve their input.

More information on [Prompt Advisor](./PROMPT_ADVISOR.md)

## Webchat Playground
Webchat Playground simplifies customizing the appearance and behavior of the copilot agent webchat, including colors, fonts, thumbnails and initials. Easy to use UI allows makers to define the look and feel of their webchat, and HTML is generated with the specified styles. 

More information on [Webchat Playground](./WEBCHAT_PLAYGROUND.md)

## Adaptive Cards Gallery
Adaptive Cards Gallery provides makers with a dozen built-in adaptive card templates for different scenarios. They demonstrate the extensibility of the adaptive card visuals and behavior, and provide examples on the agent side implementation as well on things like dynamic data binding.

## Agent Inventory (*New!*) (Preview)
Agent Inventory provides administrators with a tenant-wide view to all Copilot Studio custom agents in their organization, including detailed information on the features they are using, authentication mode, knowledge sources, orchestration type and more. Agent Inventory ships with a dashboard and the data can be exported for use in other applications.

More information on [Agent Inventory](./AGENT_INVENTORY.md)

## Agent Review Tool (*New!*)
Agent Review Tool is a solution analysis tool that can be used to review your agents for any potential issues or anti-patterns that might have negative impact on the performance or the security of your agent. After analysing the solution, Agent Review Tool presents the findings in easy to interpret format, with severity and details on how to address the issue.

More information on [Agent Review Tool](./AGENT_REVIEW_TOOL.md)

## Conversation Analyzer (*New!*) (Preview)
Conversation Analyzer allows makers to analyze the conversations of their custom agents using custom prompts to get additional insights.
