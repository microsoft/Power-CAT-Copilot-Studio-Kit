## SharePoint synchronization

SharePoint synchronization allows makers to configure periodical selective content synchronization from SharePoint locations to custom agent knowledge base as files.

Benefits of using SharePoint synchronization (compared to using SharePoint site as knowledge source):
- Support for additional file types
- Support for larger files (up to 512MB)
- Lower latency in responses
- Indexing of non-text elements in PDFs

Please see [agent configuration](./CONFIGURE_COPILOTS.md) for more details and how to configure SharePoint synchronization. SharePoint synchronization is automatically performed daily and it can be run on-demand by selecting "**Sync Files**" from the agent configuration.

You can do a dry run validation of your configuration by pressing "Validate Connection".

You can read more on the approach from [this article in Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sync-your-sharepoint-library-dataverse-how-hybrid-approach-r%C3%A9mi-dyon-8lyle)
