### [Issue #430 - Test Run Issue with No Authentication - AuthenticationNotConfigured](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/430)

**Problem:**  
I configured the agent with the ‚ÄúNo Authentication‚Äù option enabled. The Token Endpoint from the Direct Line Speech channel was added to the Agent Configuration, and Channel Security is turned off. Although my test runs complete successfully, I encounter the following error message: Sorry, the bot can't talk for a while. It's something the bot's owner needs to address. Error code: AuthenticationNotConfigured. Conversation ID: AWu1ro7B4YLJx2uLvi6Zbn-au. Time (UTC): 7/28/2025 1:30:08 AM. The Copilot agent uses a Dataverse table as a knowledge source, and I see the same error when testing the agent within the Copilot Studio test pane while the ‚ÄúNo Authentication‚Äù option is selected.

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by the ‚ÄúNo Authentication‚Äù option being enabled, which led to the bot being unable to authenticate and respond.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. Disabled the ‚ÄúNo Authentication‚Äù option in the agent configuration.  
2. Configured the agent with proper authentication settings.  
3. Verified the Token Endpoint and Channel Security settings.  
4. Tested the agent in the Copilot Studio test pane to ensure proper functionality.
