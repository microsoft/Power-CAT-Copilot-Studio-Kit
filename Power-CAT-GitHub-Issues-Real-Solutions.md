### [Issue #214 - Can't see data in Power BI report (Data Pipeline Issues)](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/214)

**Problem:**
Power BI reports showing no data despite flows running successfully. Backend Dataverse tables not populating with conversation transcripts and KPI data. Agent Transcript table empty, Agent list showing blank in reports.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple contributing factors: 1) Date format mismatch (DD/MM/YYYY vs expected MM/DD/YYYY), 2) Environment type restrictions (Developer vs Production/Sandbox), 3) Flow pagination settings for non-premium licenses, 4) Workflow Status stuck as "Pending".

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Environment Requirement:** Use Sandbox or Production environment (not Developer) for conversation transcript generation
2. **Date Format Fix:** Ensure dates are formatted as MM/DD/YYYY when passed to Generate KPI Count flows
3. **License Configuration:** For non-premium licenses, turn off pagination in flows before enabling
4. **Flow Verification:** Check these flows are enabled and running:
   - Conversation KPI | Generate Conversation KPIs Scheduler Flow (runs at 06:00 and 20:00 daily)
   - Conversation KPI | Copy Transcripts (Grandchild)
5. **Data Pipeline Check:** Verify Agent Transcript table has data before expecting KPI generation
6. **Power BI Refresh:** Refresh dashboard from Power BI service after successful flow execution
7. **Office Hours Support:** Complex data pipeline issues escalated to direct support calls

**Outcome:** Resolved by moving to Production environment and correcting date formats. User confirmed conversation transcripts now populate, though workflow status remained "Pending" requiring additional investigation.

Column security profile applied to the Secret field for additional security. Users need proper permissions to access and modify this sensitive field.

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Navigate to Dataverse Security:** Go to Settings > Security > Column Security Profiles
2. **Locate Profile:** Find the column security profile related to the Secret field
3. **Add User Access:** Add the user or team to the column security profile
4. **Grant Permissions:** Ensure users have read/write access to the profile
5. **Verify Access:** Secret field should become editable after permission changes

**Outcome:** Issue resolved immediately after adding user to column security profile. User confirmed field became accessible and editable.
