### [Issue #403 - "GenAIToolPlannerRateLimitReached" error - Test run execution](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/403)

**Problem:**  
Users getting "GenAIToolPlannerRateLimitReached" error when executing tests, wondering if this relates to Dataverse environment quotas and how to monitor request usage.

**Root Cause:**  
The `GenAIToolPlannerRateLimitReached` error occurs when the Copilot Studio (Dataverse) environment exceeds its allocated quota for AI-powered operations. This is directly related to the environment's usage limits for generative orchestration.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. **Confirm Quota Limitation**  
   - This error means the environment has hit its quota for AI operations.
2. **Monitor Current Usage and Quotas**  
   - Regularly check the environment's usage and quota status to avoid hitting the limit. See the [Dataverse Quota Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/view-quotas) guide.
3. **Resolution Options**  
   - Wait for the quota to reset (typically after a set period).
   - If frequently reaching the quota, consider upgrading the environment's capacity.
4. **Reference Official Documentation**  
   - For detailed guidance, refer to [Microsoft's documentation on API request limits and allocations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations).

**Download/Reference Links:**

- ðŸ“š [Dataverse Quota Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/view-quotas)

**Outcome:**  
Monitoring and managing the Dataverse environment's AI operation quotas is essential to prevent disruptions during test execution. If the error persists, review usage patterns and consider capacity upgrades.
