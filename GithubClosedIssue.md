### [Issue #416 - Feature request - add agent maker UPN to agent inventory](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/416)

**Problem:**  
Currently, only the maker's display name is logged into the Agent Details table. It would be great if you could also add, or replace this with, the maker's UPN. This is tricky if we use this table for agent governance related processes and have makers with the same display name.

**Root Cause:**  
The Agent Details table only logs the maker's display name, which can lead to confusion when multiple makers have the same display name.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. Updated the Agent Details table schema to include the maker's UPN.
2. Modified the data logging process to capture and store the maker's UPN along with the display name.
3. Tested the changes to ensure that the UPN is correctly logged and displayed in the Agent Details table.

**Outcome:**  
The Agent Details table now includes the maker's UPN, which helps in distinguishing between makers with the same display name and improves agent governance processes.
