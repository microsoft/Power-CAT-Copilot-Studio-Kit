### [Issue #402 - Limited access in Copilot Studio Kit despite correct roles](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/402)

**Problem:**  
I currently only have access to a single screen in Copilot Studio Kit, which includes the Features Setup Wizard, Configure Agent, and Test Runs History. However, my account has been assigned the following roles: Copilot Kit Studio - Administrator, Copilot Kit Studio - Configurator, Copilot Kit Studio - Tester/KPI Viewer. What am I missing to have access to all the features of the Kit?

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was due to additional requirements beyond role assignment, such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, environment type, licensing, and flow activation.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. **Review Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies:**  
   - Ensure all required connectors (Dataverse, SharePoint, Power Platform as Admin, Office 365 Outlook, Microsoft Entra ID, Power Apps for Makers) are allowed in your environmentâ€™s DLP policies. Restricted connectors can block feature access even with correct roles.
2. **Check Environment and Licensing:**  
   - Confirm your environment is not a preview or restricted developer environment and has proper licensing for all required connectors and features.
3. **Reinstall or Refresh the Kit:**  
   - If issues persist, reinstall the Copilot Studio Kit from AppSource and use the Setup Wizard to reconfigure the environment.
4. **Activate All Required Flows:**  
   - Make sure all Power Automate flows are activated. Toggle setup wizard flows off/on after DLP policy updates.
5. **Update to the Latest Version:**  
   - Ensure you are using the latest version of the kit, as recent releases may have changed UI options and feature availability.
