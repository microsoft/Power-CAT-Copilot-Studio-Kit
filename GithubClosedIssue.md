### [Issue #302 - Power BI Report doesn't Ingest the data from the Agent](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/302)

**Problem:**  
I've encountered the issue where on Copilot Studio Kit PROD environment I've created a Connection to Agent for Test Automation and Conversation KPIs, I've filled up the Base Configuration, Conversation KPI Settings with appropriate Bot ID, Direct Line Settings, User Authentication, Conv Transcript Enrichment, and Generative AI Testing. I've tried then to publish the Power BI Report but I have ZERO data ingested to the report. I've also encountered the issue where I can't run the tests - I have the information that 'Generated Answer Analysis' is 'Completed', but the Run status is 'Not Run', despite available Flow to see from AI Builder.

**Root Cause:**  
The required flows were not activated, causing the data ingestion and test run issues.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. Go to the Copilot Studio Kit homepage and run the Setup Wizard.  
2. Use the wizard to update all connection references.  
3. If using the managed solution, go to Default Solution â†’ Cloud Flows and turn on all mandatory flows based on the features enabled.  
4. If using the unmanaged solution, turn on the flows directly from the Setup Wizard.  
5. After enabling the flows, follow the steps to configure agents and generate KPIs.  
6. Check if the Conversation KPI table has data and verify the Power BI report again.

- [Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/)

**Outcome:**  
The issue was resolved by activating the necessary flows and updating the configurations. The Power BI report now ingests data correctly, and the tests run as expected.
