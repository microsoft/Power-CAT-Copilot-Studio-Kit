### [Issue #412 - Empty Conversation KPIs and PowerBi report](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/412)

**Problem:**  
The user was unable to see data under Conversation KPI on Copilot Studio Kit and PowerBi. Despite completing all steps, the logs ran but the table remained empty. Additionally, PowerBI reports were created but data was not fetched correctly.

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by a language mismatch between the Copilot Studio (Italian) and PowerApps (English), which led to data fetching errors.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. Verified the language settings for both Copilot Studio and PowerApps.
2. Aligned the language settings to ensure consistency.
3. Re-ran the data fetching schedule to ensure data was correctly populated.
