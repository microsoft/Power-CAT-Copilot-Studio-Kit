### [Issue #341 - Conversation KPI are blank](https://github.com/microsoft/Power-CAT-Copilot-Studio-Kit/issues/341)

**Problem:**  
I've configured an agent using the Copilot Studio kit and verified both the Agent ID and the correct environment. However, the agent still doesn't appear under the Conversation KPI section.

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was due to a misconfiguration in the environment settings which prevented the agent from being recognized under the Conversation KPI section.

**Solution Applied:**  
1. Verified the Agent ID and environment settings.  
2. Corrected the misconfiguration in the environment settings.  
3. Re-deployed the agent to ensure the changes took effect.
