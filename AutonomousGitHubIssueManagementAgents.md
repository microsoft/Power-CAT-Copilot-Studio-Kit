# Autonomous GitHub Issue Management Agents
*Powered by Microsoft Power Platform & Copilot Studio*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for two autonomous agents built using **Microsoft Copilot Studio** that will provide immediate solutions to users based on an existing knowledge source document. These agents will automatically process GitHub issues using **Power Platform webhooks** as triggers and **GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for GitHub operations like searching, filtering, adding comments, and performing semantic searches on issues and documentation. The solution leverages **Power Platform** components including **Power Automate**, **Office 365 email connector**, and **Adaptive Cards** for seamless integration and user interaction.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge Source Document Requirements

Before implementing these autonomous agents, the following prerequisite must be established:

#### 1. **Existing Knowledge Base Document**
A comprehensive knowledge source document must be created and maintained in the GitHub repository containing solution details for all or most of the GitHub issues. This document serves as the foundation for both agents' operations.

**Required Structure**:
```markdown
# Knowledge Base - Issue Solutions

## Issue Category: [Category Name]

### Issue #[Number]: [Issue Title]
**Problem Statement**: Brief description of the problem
**Environment**: Platform/version details where applicable
**Steps to Reproduce**: 
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Root Cause**: Technical explanation of why the issue occurred
**Solution Applied**: 
- Detailed solution steps
- Code changes (if applicable)
- Configuration updates
- Workarounds

**Related Issues**: Links to similar or related issues
**Tags**: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
**Resolution Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Resolved By**: @username

---
```

#### 2. **Knowledge Base Population Methods**

**Initial Population Options**:

1. **Manual Migration**: 
   - Review existing closed GitHub issues
   - Extract solution details from issue discussions
   - Format and add to knowledge base document
   - Estimated effort: 2-4 weeks depending on repository size

2. **Semi-Automated Extraction**:
   - Use GitHub MCP server to extract closed issues
   - Apply AI analysis to identify solution patterns
   - Generate structured knowledge entries
   - Manual review and refinement required
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks

3. **Gradual Population**:
   - Start with empty or minimal knowledge base
   - Allow Agent 1 to populate as new issues are closed
   - Accept lower initial effectiveness for Agent 2
   - Knowledge base grows organically over time

#### 3. **Knowledge Base Maintenance Standards**

**Quality Requirements**:
- **Completeness**: Each entry must include problem, root cause, and solution
- **Accuracy**: Solutions must be verified and tested
- **Consistency**: Follow standardized formatting and terminology
- **Accessibility**: Use clear, non-technical language where possible
- **Searchability**: Include relevant keywords and tags

**Content Guidelines**:
- Solutions should be step-by-step and actionable
- Include code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- Reference external documentation when applicable
- Maintain version-specific information where relevant
- Include screenshots or diagrams for complex procedures

#### 4. **Repository Structure Requirements**

**Recommended File Organization**:
```
repository/
??? docs/
?   ??? knowledge-base/
?   ?   ??? README.md (Knowledge Base Index)
?   ?   ??? installation-issues.md
?   ?   ??? configuration-issues.md
?   ?   ??? performance-issues.md
?   ?   ??? integration-issues.md
?   ?   ??? general-issues.md
?   ??? templates/
?       ??? issue-solution-template.md
??? .github/
?   ??? ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
?   ??? workflows/
??? README.md
```

#### 5. **GitHub Repository Configuration**

**Required Permissions**:
- Webhook creation and management
- Issue read/write access
- Repository content modification
- Comment creation and management

**Webhook Setup**:
- Configure webhooks for issue events (opened, closed, labeled)
- Ensure webhook endpoints point to Power Platform
- Implement webhook signature validation

**Labels and Categories**:
- Establish consistent labeling system for issues
- Create categories that align with knowledge base structure
- Use labels to trigger specific agent behaviors

#### 6. **Initial Knowledge Base Examples**

**Sample Entry for Common Issue**:
```markdown
### Issue #123: Application Fails to Start After Update

**Problem Statement**: Users report that the application crashes immediately after updating to version 2.1.0

**Environment**: 
- Windows 10/11
- Application version 2.1.0
- .NET Framework 4.8

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Update application from version 2.0.x to 2.1.0
2. Launch application
3. Application crashes with error "System.IO.FileNotFoundException"

**Root Cause**: Missing configuration file migration during update process

**Solution Applied**:
1. Navigate to application installation directory
2. Copy `config.xml` from backup location to `\Config\` folder
3. Run application as administrator for first launch
4. Verify application starts successfully

**Code Fix** (if applicable):
```csharp
// Updated installer to preserve config files
installer.PreserveDuringUpdate("Config/*.xml");
```

**Related Issues**: #124, #125
**Tags**: [installation, update, configuration, windows]
**Resolution Date**: 2024-01-15
**Resolved By**: @maintainer
```

#### 7. **Success Metrics for Knowledge Base**

**Coverage Metrics**:
- **Issue Coverage**: Percentage of historical issues documented
- **Category Distribution**: Balanced coverage across issue types
- **Solution Effectiveness**: Success rate of documented solutions
- **Search Performance**: Ability to find relevant solutions quickly

**Quality Metrics**:
- **Solution Accuracy**: Percentage of solutions that resolve issues
- **Completeness Score**: Average completeness of knowledge entries
- **User Feedback**: Ratings on solution helpfulness
- **Maintenance Currency**: How up-to-date solutions remain

## Business Case & Need

### Why This Solution is Needed

1. **Manual Overhead Reduction**: Currently, knowledge base maintenance requires manual intervention to capture solutions from resolved issues, leading to inconsistent documentation and knowledge loss.

2. **Response Time Improvement**: New issues often require manual research through existing solutions, documentation, and previous issues, resulting in delayed responses to users.

3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Valuable problem-solving insights from resolved issues are often lost if not properly documented, leading to repeated work on similar problems.

4. **Scalability**: As the project grows, manual management of issues and knowledge base becomes increasingly impractical.

5. **Consistency**: Automated agents ensure consistent formatting, categorization, and quality of knowledge base entries.

6. **Enterprise Integration**: Leveraging Power Platform ensures seamless integration with existing Microsoft 365 ecosystem and enterprise security standards.

- Ensuring consistency in documentation and responses using standardized templates
- Creating a self-improving knowledge ecosystem with continuous learning capabilities
- Leveraging enterprise-grade security and compliance through Microsoft's trusted platform

The implementation will result in faster issue resolution, better knowledge retention, improved user satisfaction, and reduced workload on project maintainers while maintaining full integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

### GitHub MCP Server Usage

The GitHub MCP server is utilized for the following operations:

1. **Search Operations**:
   - Semantic search across GitHub issues
   - Filter issues by labels, status, and metadata
   - Search repository documentation and README files
   - Query knowledge base documents

2. **Content Operations**:
   - Add comments to GitHub issues
   - Update knowledge base documents
   - Retrieve issue details and attachments
   - Access repository documentation

3. **Analysis Operations**:
   - Perform similarity analysis between issues
   - Extract relevant code snippets and examples
   - Analyze issue patterns and trends

**Note**: GitHub MCP servers handle GitHub-specific operations but cannot serve as webhook triggers. Power Platform webhooks receive GitHub webhook events and trigger the Copilot Studio agents, which then use GitHub MCP servers for GitHub operations.
