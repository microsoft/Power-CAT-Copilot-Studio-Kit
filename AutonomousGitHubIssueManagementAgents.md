# Autonomous GitHub Issue Management Agents

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for two autonomous agents built using **Microsoft Copilot Studio** that will provide immediate solutions to users based on an existing knowledge source document. These agents will automatically process GitHub issues and **GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for GitHub operations like searching, filtering, adding comments, and performing semantic searches on issues and documentation. The solution leverages **Power Automate**, **Office 365 email connector**, and **Adaptive Cards** for seamless integration and user interaction.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge Source Document Requirements

Before implementing these autonomous agents, the following prerequisite must be established:

#### 1. **Existing Knowledge Base Document**

A comprehensive knowledge source document must be created and maintained in the GitHub repository containing solution details for all or most of the GitHub issues. This document serves as the foundation for both agents' operations.

**Required Structure**:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base - Issue Solutions

## Issue Category: [Category Name]

### Issue #[Number]: [Issue Title]

**Problem Statement**: Brief description of the problem
**Environment**: Platform/version details where applicable
**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Root Cause**: Technical explanation of why the issue occurred

- Automatically capturing and organizing solution knowledge through AI-powered analysis
- Providing immediate assistance to users with new issues via intelligent search capabilities
- Reducing manual overhead for maintainers through automated workflows
- Ensuring consistency in documentation and responses using standardized templates
- Creating a self-improving knowledge ecosystem with continuous learning capabilities
- Leveraging enterprise-grade security and compliance through Microsoft's trusted platform

The implementation will result in faster issue resolution, better knowledge retention, improved user satisfaction, and reduced workload on project maintainers while maintaining full integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

### GitHub MCP Server Usage

The GitHub MCP server is utilized for the following operations:

1. **Search Operations**:

   - Semantic search across GitHub issues
   - Filter issues by labels, status, and metadata
   - Search repository documentation and README files
   - Query knowledge base documents

2. **Content Operations**:

   - Add comments to GitHub issues
   - Update knowledge base documents
   - Retrieve issue details and attachments
   - Access repository documentation

3. **Analysis Operations**:
   - Perform similarity analysis between issues
   - Extract relevant code snippets and examples
   - Analyze issue patterns and trends

**Note**: Copilot Studio autonomous agents provide built-in triggers for GitHub events, eliminating the need for separate webhook infrastructure. GitHub MCP servers handle GitHub-specific operations and are used by the Copilot Studio agents to perform GitHub API interactions.
